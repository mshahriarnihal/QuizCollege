Old Results shows all your previous attempts' scores with date and time. You can find the same information on your dashboard (My Profile tab) too, but it is basically your dashboard, which shows more details, like greets you with your name, shows your highest score till now, total number of attempts etc too. You can start a new game from this page too if you want. Leaderboard page shows the top 10 competitor. Top 3 gets gold, silver, and bronzze medal in ordeer by the way! :P As you can select how many questions to answer, we don't just blindly announce top correct scorer as winner, rather we value the ratio!
- After each quiz, users see their total score, Color-coded breakdown of each question, Correct vs. selected answers.
 
Authentication:
- We have JWT-based signup & login Auth tokens stored securely in localStorage
- Protected routes: quiz, results, profile, and leaderboard pages require user's login to guarantee our user's privacy and data security.

Shareable Results:
- Every quiz attempt generates a unique result ID
- Therefore, you can share your scorecard (result link) with friends (requires login to view to maintain our privacy btw)

Additionally:
- Clean animations, interactive UI, modal quiz setup
- Reusable auth utility functions for all pages
- MongoDB schema tracks not just scores, but full quiz metadata
- Heroku deployment with MongoDB Atlas backend
- The limited timer makes your experience even more thrilling!

### Work for the project 3 starts here.... Some necessary updates and planning: 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~01:01 a.m.

- I have started working on backend, trying to learn basics about MongoDB, Mongoose.
- I have started working server.js file, which in project 2 was mostly developed by Md Akram Hossain with very little modification by me during the deployment phase.
- While modifying the server.js to meet requirements of project 3, I am assuming that we will have signup and login pages named as "signup.html" and "signin.html."

**For now, I am expecting Md Akram Hossain to start working on "signin.html," and inside the signin page, please refer to the sign up page's directory as "signin.html", no need to add anything else before it, as we will put these files in same folder when we gather everything together.**


### Commit #14: Signup Page 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~07:35 a.m.

- I have finished working on the signup page front end, also wrote logics, fetch, to make it work soon.
- I have also finished working on backend to do the authentication with both sign up and sign in, assuming that Md Akram Hossain will complete and upload a page named "signing.html". I have set up the server.js assuming it.
- I have also connected the mongo db, currently trying to upload each user's data to mongo db. For that reason, I am not pushing the updated server.js right now as it needs more works. I will push final server.js once everything is finalized.

### Commit #15: SignIn Page 
**Author**: Akram Hossain  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~3:35 p.m.

- I have finished working on the SignIN page front end.
- Expecting Partner for to finish backend part for the signin page.

### Commit #16: LeaderBoard

**Date, Time**: July 28, ~3:35 p.m.

- I have finished working on the LeaderBoard page front end.
- Expecting Partner for to finish backend logic part for the LeadeBoard page.so it can count the percentage instead of direct scores

### Commit #17: Result and Results history page
**Author**: Akram Hossain  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~4.11 p.m.
Shared Result View: Displays a public quiz result fetched from the server using a unique result ID passed via URL query parameter (?id=).Personal Result View: Shows the user's recent quiz result stored in localStorage after completing a quiz.
Fetches and displays shared quiz results from the server using /api/result/{id}.Shows personal quiz results from localStorage.this is the modified version of the older 1


### Commit #18: Results history page
**Author**: Akram Hossain  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~5.11 p.m.
Authentication:
#1. Checks for a token in localStorage and redirects to signin.html if absent.
Includes a redundant check at the top of the page to ensure reliability, as the app.js version was unreliable in some cases.
#2. API Fetch:
Fetches user history from /api/user-history?username=<username>.
Handles errors (e.g., network issues or no results) with user-friendly messages.
#3. Result Rendering:
Sorts results by date (oldest first) and generates HTML for each attempt.
Displays score, date, and a detailed summary with color-coded answers (green for correct, red for incorrect).


### Commit #19: Profile page 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~05:03 p.m.

- I have kept it protected too so that it is accessible when user is logged in (checks for token in localStorage, redirects to signin otherwise). The main logic part of this you can find inside app.js, I have developed it there and instructed Md Akram Hossain to utilize it in the pages he was working (if he thinks it is needed for those pages).
- It fetches user quiz history and stats from backend (/api/user-history) using the stored username.
- Also, displays a welcome/greeting, then shows an overview of the specific player like highest score, total quiz attempts, and then showed the chronological list of all quiz attempts (with date and score).
- I kept the "Start New Quiz" button to make navigation easier.
- Also defined how to handle error by showing error messages if unable to load history.



### Commit #20: index.html mofidication for project 3 (Full and Final version, update 4.1.0) 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~05:14 p.m.

- Adding new pages which we had to create additionally for project #3 (merged version)

- Updating information about the features as we have added some new features for the new update (Project 3)

- This should be the final version of index.html (home page) of our project's final version (Project 3).



### Commit #21: quiz.html mofidication for project 3 (Full and Final version, update 3.1.1) 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~05:25 p.m.

- I have modified and further enhanced quiz.html with user-customizable quiz options using Trivia API considering the requirements and options for project 3

- When I worked on project 2, I worked on this entire section, but it was so plain and straight used to load questions from question.json file. Now, as we are switching to Trivia API to load questions, I followed my instructors suggestions to make the game more interesting.

- Implemented a modal dialog (triggered on page load) allowing users to select quiz difficulty, category, and number of questions before starting the quiz.

- It dynamically fetches and populates available trivia categories from the Open Trivia DB API using JavaScript (fetch call in DOMContentLoaded).

- Difficulty selection is mapped to age ranges (easy: <13, medium: 13-19, hard: >19) to promote balanced competition and appropriate question sets.

- Users can set number of questions (5â€“50) for a personalized quiz length (Ofc thanks to Trivia API), and also to the instructor for suggesting and introducing it.

- All selections are passed to the backend to generate quizzes accordingly.

- I have now mad it completely integrated with existing quiz flow, navigation controls, dark mode toggle, and audio feedback (correct/wrong sounds).

- I believe it Improves user experience and fairness, making the leaderboard more meaningful across different age groups. As I worked with this Trivia API, I instructed my partner to modify and update the leaderboard.html page according to this as he was working on that part



### Commit #22: Modified final CSS for project 3 (update 4.1) 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~05:37 p.m.


- This last modification of our CSS file is made by Mubasshir Al Shahriar, although the main file was initially designed by Md Akram Hossain with some small contributions and later modifications by Mubasshir Al Shahriar.

- For the modifications it needed for project 3 was done by Mubasshir Al Shahriar. Here I have added some new classes for the "difficulty-modal" and "difficulty-content."

- Any other changes/modifications that I made previously on this file (update 3.1) were for project 2.






### Commit #23: Modified and Final app.js for project 3 (update 2.1) 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~06:02 p.m.


- During project 2, I have coded this entire app.js, defining all required logics, actions.

- Now for project 3, I have modified this to meet all requirements and make some more features lively which we planned and worked on

- Added reusable JWT-based authentication (put JWT security in .env file, I am not going to post the .env file to ignore security risk) logic (setToken, getToken, clearAuth, getUsername) to store user session in localStorage.

- Enforced access control: quiz, results, and history pages are now protected; unauthenticated users are redirected to signin.
Implemented dynamic navbar update showing logged-in user and logout button; logout clears credentials and redirects. As I have defined the logic here, me and my partner Md Akram Hossain both can utilize it on any page wherever it is necessary just by using the function.

- Extended quiz flow to support difficulty, category, and question count selection via modal (with logic to capture and use these on quiz start).

- Updated quiz submission to post selected options and username to backend, supporting category/difficulty leaderboards and analytics.

- Removed quiz backtracking (prevBtn) for answer integrity; I actually made this modification right after adding the sound feedback provided after answer selection.

- Added result sharing via unique result ID, including share-to-clipboard and navigator. Pressing the share button, it will enable the user to get a unique id which will contain their result which using the link with id they can share with friends, social media (I set it in a way so that they can share, but to view the full result, those people will need to sign in, then they can see that friend's result. I did it to maintain result, question-answer's integrity.

- To better understand the modifications, please check the comments inside the code, I tried to explain it nicely.



### Commit #24: Pushed User.js 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~06:15 p.m.

- As I worked and finished set up MongoDB already (I did it yesterday night), now working on the User.js part to transmit data properly
- Here I have extended scores array to store additional quiz metadata: difficulty (quiz level), category (quiz subject), and amount (number of questions per quiz attempt).
- The scores array in each user document now records not only the score, total, and date, but also the difficulty level, category, and number of questions for every quiz attempt.
- This structure enables richer statistics and filtering (for example: viewing highest scores by category/difficulty, or analyzing performance trends based on quiz settings etc which in this project we have not utilized that much, but later if work more on it, probably I will utilize it, that's why kept the structure like this).
- These changes are very much helpful to support new Project 3 features such as difficulty/category leaderboards and personalized profile statistics.



### Commit #25: QuizResult.js Schema for Project 3 
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~06:32 p.m.

- Here I am adding difficulty, category, and amount fields to each quiz result for keeping track. Maybe I could do it using only User.js, but I was having some trouble and later fixed it with this additional file. Through this file, I am also setting defaults for all new fields to ensure compatibility with legacy records.



### Commit #26: server.js updated version for Project 3 (update 3.1)
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar  
**Date, Time**: July 28, ~07:16 p.m.

Until project 2, Md Akram Hossain worked on this server.js. But after starting project 3, as I (Mubasshir) did the MongoDB setup and took care of the app.js too, it was more convenient and efficient to take charge of this server setup part by myself considering the limited time we have. So, I made necessary modification for this project 3 version of server.js. In this update 3.1, I am bringing following modifications:

- Implemented JWT-based authentication for user signup/signin; and also protected sensitive API routes.

- Enhanced /api/start-quiz further by making it accept and process difficulty, category, and amount query params, supporting custom quiz generation from both local DB and Open Trivia DB API.

- Modified /api/submit-quiz to keep record of quiz attempts with difficulty, category, and amount in both User and QuizResult collections.

- Added /api/user-history and /api/leaderboard endpoints for fetching filtered quiz stats by user, category, and difficulty.

- These are the main things I did as new update for the project 3 version of server.
- As I had to make changes very often in app.js and server.js, I am pushing the final update of these 2 file almost after finalizing all other files.



### Commit #27: Further enhancing leaderboard.html page's look & further addition in CSS
**Author**: Mubasshir Al Shahriar

- Original author of leaderboard.html page is Md Akram Hossain. But as it was looking very basic, on top of all the codes my partner wrote, I (Mubasshir) am adding some modification to make the leaderboard/table look little more enhanced/fancy. 

- To make it actually work, I have also added some additional class to the end of the CSS file (for ex: "leaderboard-glass," "@Keyframes leaderboard-fadein," ".fancy-leaderboard-list" etc).

- Next, I am going to wrap everything up, write an overview for the final (mergerd project 2 + project 3) project, re-deploy on heroku and add the ip address of the heroku app to MongoDB.

- Finally we have reached our goal.
- I have set the accessing IP address for my MongoDB cluster0 to 0.0.0.0/0 to ensure proper access from heroku app
- I have deployed everything on heroku successfully after ensuring the final touch and revise for all files and set up the MongoURI and JWT correctly.
- After deployment, I have run the webapp several times, tested, and made sure everything is working perfectly.
- Thanks if you reached here skimming or reading or anyhow. Big thanks to my group partner Md Akram Hossain for his valuable time and kind cooperation. Also, thanks to our instructor Professor Nikola Baci for kind support and valuable guidances.
